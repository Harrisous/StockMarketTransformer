## Topic

**Stock market prediction using environment embedding and transformer.**

---

## Themes

- Finance
- Technology

---

## Approaches

- **Naive approach:** Mean model
- **Classical ML approach:** Non-deep learning techniques
- **Deep learning approach:** Neural network-based (Transformer)

---

## Deep Learning Approach Specification

- **Input Data:** Tensor of shape `[batch_size, seq_len, input_dim]`, where `input_dim` includes features like high price, low price, and volume.
- **Output Predictions:** Tensor of shape `[batch_size, seq_len-1, input_dim]`, predicting the next vector for each timestep except the last during training.
- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSELoss), suitable for regression tasks.

**Model specs**
The model is a transformer with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style feedforward block, where a router dynamically combines outputs from multiple experts for each token in the sequence. This design allows for more flexible and powerful modeling of complex time series data.

In each transformer block, by the order of input to output, there are LayerNorm [${LayerNorm}(x) = \gamma \cdot \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta$],  multiheadattention layer, add&norm(with skip connection), LayerNorm, router & MoE layer (shared+specialized), and add&norm layer(with skip connection).

**Inference:**  
During inference or testing on unseen data, the `predict` function generates predictions without requiring target labels.

## Process for Replicating the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Install required libraries.
4. Run `make_dataset.py`.
5. Run `data_processing.py`.
6. **For NN model:**
   - Run `model_training_nn.py` to train the neural network (set `previous_model` to `None` for first training).
   - Run `model_test_nn.py` to test the NN model.
7. Run `model_test_naive.py` to evaluate the naive model (real-time training).
8. Run `model_test_ml.py` to evaluate the ML model (real-time training).

## Continuous Development Log

- Jun 6, 2026: 
   1. added model specs; âœ…
   2. start training original model until convergence; 
   3. update the prediction functionality to include most recent macro data. 

- Next plan: try smaller time interals and seek for short term opportunities; prediction target shift to mean and variation for result interpretability.
